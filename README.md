TELOS (Twitter-like Vocabulary App)
===

## What's TELOS?
TELOS is a Twitter-like vocabulary app built with Ruby on Rails. It is designed to be maximizing your linguistic ability, making it to be possible to memorize vocabulary faster than ever.

## Key Features
### Timeline
Timeline(TL) displays all the words posted by each user on TELOS. Just browsing TL is not enough, but would be a good starting point of your upcoming journey.
### Follow Your Favorite Users
Follow your favorite users to prioritize their posts over others'.
### Tags
Attach tags to words to help you and others categorize them. Start memorizing words by categories.
### Likes
Give your likes to the posts you think deserve them. The number of likes of each post determines where it is placed in the tag lists described above.
### Activity Log
It's not easy to keep track of your daily progress manually (how many words did I memorize today etc.). Yet TELOS will do that for you. It records your activities on TELOS (how many words you've posted, you've liked etc.) and displays the result in a nice-looking graph.
